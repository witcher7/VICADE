OS --> operating system
is a piece of software that helps us
to interact with computer
if we dont have os then it is piece of
black box that is dumb saying 10s

IN 1967-70s
IN at&t they built OS --> UNIX
stariting UNIX was kernal

kernal --> bridge through which
we helps in accessing hardware easily



MObile game -----> you need more ram
                   and cpu
                  (HARDWARE)
who is going to request hardware to 
give that data
 --------------> kernal who acts
as a bridge between hardware and software
through which we access hardware resources

kernal --> software 

     UNIX
  [] ----> []

people were adding more softwares with unix 
and selling it and naming them as OS 


MAC
IBM 
SUN SYSTEM --> they were selling OS in 1000 dollars

in 1993--> LINuS TORVALDS also faced this issue
and made LINUX

IN LINUX [ GNU softwares --> OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARES}
they dont need liscense

linux became more popular than unix

 but linux is not similar to unix
 linux was built seeing unix as a standard

  linux = unix --> they are not same
 unix --> kernal and linux with GNU software  OS

                        KERNAL 

APPLICATION ---> OS --->      ---> HARDWARE 

 
LINUX --> 
    ---->  FREE OF USE 
   
      --> MORE FAST AND FAST as compare to windows
      --> windows is home of viruses
      --> IN linux --> it is quite tough --> virus
          linux has a different file system
automatically virus is removed from linux
      --> linux requires less resource
windows --> 5gb of ram and good cpu to act perfectly
  linux --> in 512mb of ram 1 core cpu
  ---> linux --> GUI (graphical user interface)
             --> CLI ( command line interface)
      

CLI --> LINUX --> 512 mb of ram

GUI --> LINUX --> 2gb of ram
