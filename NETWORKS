network types


1. can 
campus area network
hospital,organization,
school,university
having campus


[] --------> 
company A

lan -> local area network

[] [] []
        --> locality area network
[] [] []

upto 1km ---> data loss will be there



man --> metropolitan area network
cities connected to each other forming 
a network
upto 10 kms

wan --> wide area network 
which connects provinces,regions,countries
forming a network





NETWORK TOPOLOGIES

way of setting up a network
structure of a network

1. linear topology 

[] --> [] --> [] --> []

2. ring topology
in this structure the device is connected
forwardly and one device in back
                   []
                  /  \
                []    []
                |      |
               []     []
                |      |
               []     []
                 \   /
                  []
3 fully connected / mesh topology


each and every device is connected
to each other forming fully connected
structure


              / [] \
            []--|--[]
              \ | /
               [] 
                
4 STAR TOPOLOGY
master slave ARCHITECTURE

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DEVICES
1. MASTER NODE
CENTRAL MACHINE WHICH CONTROLS
ALL THE OTHER WORKING NODES ACTING
AS SLAVES
 


2. SLAVE /WORKING NODE
WORKER NODES WHICH ARE BEING CONTROLLED
BY THE MASTER NODE

--> IF THE MASTER NODE GOES DOWN
THE WORKER NODES ARE QUITE UNUSEFULL

DATA LINK LAYER
the logical addressing happens


MAC address --> media access control
there is a physical address of your machine
so that other machines can identify
you


wifi --> ipad X
     --> mobile phone X
     --> tv  X
     --> laptop asking for internet
permenant address given by the 
manufacturers of the device while making
it and it is used as landmark for your
device
so that whenever other devices
wants to connect with your device
they would be able to know about yourplace


2. IP ADDRESS

Internet protocol address
it gives you identity to travel 
the world of internet


          internet (web)
[] ---->  ip address --> so that 
everyone should know your location 
where are you

ISP -->  ROUTER/WIFI MODEM --> devices --> WWW
     ip (internet)
WWW --> world wide web
is a collection of documents and data stored
on the computers connected to each other globally
that can be accessible over the links
and links on links(hyperlinks)
